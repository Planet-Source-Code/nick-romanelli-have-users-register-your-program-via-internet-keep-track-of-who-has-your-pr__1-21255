</div>

### Description

Have your users register your program via an ftp. Heres how it works, when the program loads, it checks an ini for a value, if its there, it skips the registration form and goes right to the program, if its not there it brings up the registartion screen, once the 411 is filled out, a txt file is created the filename is the same as the first field (name), then uploaded to an ftp of your choice! I hope you find this code useful, if you do PLEASE VOTE! and also please leave me feedback!
